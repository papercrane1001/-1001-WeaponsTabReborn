	## Weapons Tab
- Adds a 'Weapons' tab to the bottom bar that lets you view what weapons each colonist has equipped
- Lets you create weapon loadouts and assign each colonist a loadout
- Colonists will automatically pick up weapons that are allowed in their current loadout (and drop thier weapon if it is not allowed)
- If a colonist sees that a better quality of the same weapon is available, they will swap out for the better one

## Fun fact
- I made this mod because I was playing in a game with 100 colonists and was tired of manually assigning a weapon to each one

## Requires
- The Harmony workshop item is required for this mod to work: steam://url/CommunityFilePage/2009463077

## Incompatibilities
- Currently incompatible with Multiplayer, hope to fix that soon
